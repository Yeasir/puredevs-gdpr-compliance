PureDevs GDPR compliance can minimize the risk of getting penalized by GDPR. It's packed with all the premium features of other plugins, but for free!

== Description ==

GDPR is a set of regulatory rules and regulations that you have to abide by in order to conduct online business within any country of the EU. Violating these rules may result in penalization. Breaching GDPR will result in penalization of either up to 20 million or fines up to 4% of the annual global turnover of the preceding year, whichever is greater.

If you want to collect data from any European Union citizen, you need to take consent from them; failing to do so can put your business at risk. Using plugins like PureDevs GDPR compliance can help you minimize the risk of getting penalized.
